Hello! Sagnic this side.

So, basically this is a repository where I stored some basic codes during learning Computer Vision using OpenCV in Python.

Here I have learnt the following things:
1) Reading & storing and image
2) Reading a video
3) Reading from our webcam
4) Resizing images
5) Cropping images
6) Blurring an image
7) Applying threshold to an image to differentiate an object from the surroundings
8) Edge detection in an Image
9) Drawing using opencv tools
10) Contours in an image to identify the objects
11) Convert BGR colorspace to HSV colorspace (getting a range of values of HSV for a particular BGR value)
12) Object Detection in Real Time on the basis of colour of the object
